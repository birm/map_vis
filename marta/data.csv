Currently there is only a stop sign at Haynes St SW and no traffic calming/red light/stop sign on Peters St SW. There is a stop light at the top of the hill at Peters St / Fair, but it is often green, so cars are already speeding by the time they come down the hill. This creates a dangerous impediment for residents trying to cross Peters St SW since there is NO crosswalk either.

Bike lanes on Peters St SW were made so wide with the re-striping a few years ago that most vehicles assume it’s a secondary lane, creating unsafe areas for bicycles (and pedestrians forced to stand along those lanes). Every day I witness cars going into the bike lane to get around cars that are waiting to turn onto Haynes St SW.

During construction of new apartments right there, the MARTA bus stop and sidewalk at that area were completely blocked forcing pedestrians to stand in the road to catch the bus. I was able to submit requests to ATL311 to have a temporary bus stop moved a few yards north to an unblocked area.

The main issues is there is NO crosswalk for pedestrians to cross Peters St SW to get to the bus stop at this intersection, forcing us to dart in between cars each morning. This is going to become even worse once all of the new offices and apartments open this year in the area. I have sent messages to Councilwoman Cleta Winslow as well as State Rep. Pat Gardner--but I've yet to hear any response. I've also included in those messages numerous photos that I've taken to prove all of the above points, all in an effort to bring this dangerous intersection to light and try to create a safer area for pedestrians and cyclists.",35.547,3.306,38.853,0,0,0
